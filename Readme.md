# Some d3 experiments

To get the json files to load, you need to be running an http server in the directory you want to serve.  For example 

    $ cd usMap
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9001

will start a webserver on localhost:9001, and you can go to localhost:9001/usMap.html to see that file
